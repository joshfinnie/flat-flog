flat-flog
=========

An flat-page blog written in Python using the Flask Microframework and its extensions. It comes with [Twitter Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and some default template to get you started. This idea was stemmed from a blog post by [James Harding](http://www.jamesharding.ca/posts/simple-static-markdown-blog-in-flask/).


Installation
------------

Create a virtualenv and install the requirements.

    virtualenv .
    source bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a Post
-------------

To create a new post, simplely create a new file in the `flat_flog/_content/_posts` folder. Flat Flog will automatically pull it out and render the Markdown into a blog post. The `flat_flog/_content/_drafts` folder is where you can put drafts of blog posts you are not ready to publish.

The format of a post entry is as followed:

    title: ** YOUR TITLE HERE **
    date: ** TODAY'S DATE **
    tags: ['** TAG 1 **', '** TAG 2 **', etcâ€¦]

    ** THE BODY OF THE POST HERE **

Create a Page
-------------

Creating a page is very similar to creating a new blog post. You would want to put the content of the page you want to create in the `flat_flog/_content/_pages` folder.

The format of a page is as followed:

    title: ** YOUR TITLE HERE **

    ** THE BODY OF THE PAGE HERE **

Serve in development
--------------------

To serve your blog while developing, you can simplely run it as a Flask application. Run the following command to serve the content of your blog dynamically:

    cd flat_flog
    python blog.py

This will allow you to see your blog at <http://0.0.0.0:5000/>. Since `DEBUG=True` any changes made to your blog will auto-reload allowing for easier developement.

Freeze your blog
----------------

After you are done development of your blog, you want to freeze your blog to create a static version of it for deployment. This is done by the following command:

    cd flat_flog
    python blog.py build

This will create a `_site` folder with your static blog. You can then host these files anywhere.

You can also easily test your static website by entering the following:

    c./_site
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

This should serve your site at <http://0.0.0.0:8000>.

TODO
----

List of things I want to get done:

* Make tags work better.
* Implement time-sorted archive (maybe...)
* Expand on `Config` file for more personalization.
